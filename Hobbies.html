<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Hobbies play an important role in personal growth and relaxation, providing a way
    to unwind and explore interests outside of work or studies. They allow individuals
    to develop new skills, express creativity, and stay mentally and physically active.
    Whether engaging in solo activities or group-based hobbies, these pastimes contribute
    to a balanced and fulfilling life. Having hobbies also helps in building discipline, 
    improving focus, and even opening up new opportunities. Below are some of the hobbies I enjoy:</p>
